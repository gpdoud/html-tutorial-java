# War   

War is a game played against another War use.

Each player starts with 20 points. Each player presses a button to generate a random number between 1 and 10. Once a number is generated, each player tells the other what their number is. If both players have the same number, that game is a draw and no change in score. If one player's number is greater than the other, each player clicks the Winner or Loser buttons and both player's scores are changed.

When one player's score is zero, that player loses.

## War2

War2 is everything that War is except when there is a tie. In that case, the point value for the next game is changed from 1 to 5 meaning the winner gets 5 points while the loser loses 5 points. To designate a tie, another button is created between the Winner and Loser button called WAR!
