# War   

War is a game played against another War use.

Each player starts with 20 points. Each player presses a button to generate a random number between 1 and 10. Once a number is generated, each player tells the other what their number is. If both players have the same number, that game is a draw and no change in score. If one player's number is greater than the other, each player clicks the Winner or Loser buttons and both player's scores are changed.

When one player's score is zero, that player loses.
